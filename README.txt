What i understand  :
the gaussian blur
the system of octave
coefficient gauss-kleine
opencv in python (fonction resize, GaussianBlur ect ...)
Dot picture (not sure)

Next time :
understand Keypoint find (normally it's easy I hope..)
see keypoint oriantation
see how to do for the next (register the output data/picture, multiply the picture for better better output or testing with an test picture.
maybe start to implement what i understand.
